# productivity-tab
This is a very simple and surprisingly effective productivity tool:

It just alerts you every few minutes to switch tasks.  

There are 3 versions of this tool:

1. A simple html file that you can open in your browser and is available online at https://ayfal.github.io/productivity-tab/

2. A pyw file that you can run on your computer (you need to have python installed). It supports a small comma separated list of tasks. 

3. A docm file that you can open in ms-word. This version has a task list (with all the capabilities of ms-word) and simple yet effective prioritizing system.
